                <li> f. request the erasure of your data (also known as the right to be forgotten);</li>
                <li> g. withdraw your consent to the processing of your data; and</li>
                <li> h. lodge a complaint with a relevant authority where you have reason to believe that we have violated the term(s) of this Privacy Notice. (You may complain or seek redress from us within 30 days from when you first detected the alleged violation).</li>

             </p>
              <br />
            <p> You may  seek to exercise any of the above rights at any time by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:info@gbenda.org" class="text-primary">info@gbenda.org</a></p>

            <br/>
             <p>We will normally not share your information with anyone, however, we may disclose your information with legal and regulatory authorities when they request it.
